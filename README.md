# Miscellaneous
In here there are some of my early work with plain C#, WinForms and java

In "Projekti" directory there are some of my early work on C#. Most of them are just code without anykind of specification, because when i sstarted out in coding,
I just had the assignment on my other screen and coded. I did'nt really understand the crucial thing of maybe putting these up somewhere at some point,
but sorry for the messy folder, i just thought it is good to have these in rather than not!

In "WinForms" directory there is some of my WindowsForms works, I have not put the group assignments in here, because in those it is really hard to separate my work
from my fellow students work.
